# create-pet-project

A very opinionated way to initiate a type-safe backend project to move fast while keeping code-base very adaptable to changes. Supports multiple databases (postgres, mongo, redis) through the repository design pattern. Supports both TRPC and normal REST routes for different use-cases. Comes with JWT tokens or Session tokens already implemented.
